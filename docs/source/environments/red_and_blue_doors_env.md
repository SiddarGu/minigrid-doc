# Red and blue doors

The agent is randomly placed within a room with one red and one blue door
facing opposite directions. The agent has to open the red door and then open
the blue door, in that order. Note that, surprisingly, this environment is
solvable without memory.

Registered configurations:
- `MiniGrid-RedBlueDoors-6x6-v0`
- `MiniGrid-RedBlueDoors-8x8-v0`
