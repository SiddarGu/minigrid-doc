# Key corridor

This environment is similar to the locked room environment, but there are
multiple registered environment configurations of increasing size,
making it easier to use curriculum learning to train an agent to solve it.
The agent has to pick up an object which is behind a locked door. The key is
hidden in another room, and the agent has to explore the environment to find
it. The mission string does not give the agent any clues as to where the
key is placed. This environment can be solved without relying on language.
