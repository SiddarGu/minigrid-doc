# Memory

This environment is a memory test. The agent starts in a small room
where it sees an object. It then has to go through a narrow hallway
which ends in a split. At each end of the split there is an object,
one of which is the same as the object in the starting room. The
agent has to remember the initial object, and go to the matching
object at split.
