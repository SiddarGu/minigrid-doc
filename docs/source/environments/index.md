# Included environments

The environments listed below are implemented in the [minigrid/envs](/minigrid/envs) directory.
Each environment provides one or more configurations registered with OpenAI gym. Each environment
is also programmatically tunable in terms of size/complexity, which is useful for curriculum learning
or to fine-tune difficulty.
